# Arducurity

**Arducurity** is a project that allows the implementation of **Arduino** boards connected to a **web page**. This system aims to integrate Arduino boards for data management and device control through a web interface, providing remote access and efficient real-time management.

## Description

The main goal of this project is to connect one or more **Arduino** boards to a web page to interact with the data in real time. Through this web page, users can control devices connected to the boards and view information or sensors that are being monitored by the hardware.

The key features of the project include:
- **Real-time monitoring** of sensors and devices connected to Arduino.
- **Intuitive web interface** to visualize sensor data and control devices.
- **Remote control** of devices connected to Arduino boards, from anywhere with web access.

## Features

- User interface based on **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- Connection between the Arduino board and the web page through **REST API** or **WebSocket**.
- Control of inputs and outputs of Arduino boards from the web.
- Real-time visualization of data, such as sensor values or the status of connected devices.
- Implementation of a basic **security** system for accessing the control interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino** (for hardware)
- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (for the web interface)
- **Node.js** or **PHP** (for the backend, if needed)
- **REST API** or **WebSocket** (for communication between the web and Arduino)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install the **Arduino** development environment and a compatible **Arduino board** (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.).
2. Install **Node.js** (if you're using JavaScript for the backend) or a suitable web server (e.g., **Apache** if you're using PHP).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Open the terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arducurity.git
   cd arducurity
